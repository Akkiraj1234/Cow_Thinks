# 🐄 Cow_Thinks  
**My first-ever C++ project!** 🎉  

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to **Cow_Thinks**, a small project that I’m building to learn C++ while having some fun. This app is like a playful cow that can "think" and say things when you tell it to, using simple command-line commands. 🐮💭  

> **Note**: This is my first project in C++, and I’m learning as I go. So if you see anything that’s not written well or seems off, please be kind. I’m doing my best and improving as I learn! 💖

---

## 🛠️ **Features**
- 🗣️ **Talk like a cow**: Pass a message, and the cow will "say" it back to you.
- 🗄️ **Store messages**: Messages are saved in a local SQLite database.
- 🌐 **Fetch data from a server**: (Coming soon!)
- ⏲️ **Run all the time**: Make the cow think in the background like a pro! (Coming soon!)

---

## 📦 **How to Run**
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cow_thinks.git
   cd cow_thinks
   ```

3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o cow_thinks -lsqlite3
   ```

4. Run the program:
   ```
   ./cow_thinks -say "Hello, world!"
   ```

## 💡 Why I’m Building This

I haven’t officially learned C++ yet, but I wanted to try building something fun while learning the language. This project is helping me explore:

- How to create a command-line application.
- How to store and retrieve data using a local SQLite database.
- Cross-platform development (making this work on both Linux and Windows).

It’s a challenge, but I’m excited to see where this journey takes me! 🚀

## 🤗 A Special Message

If you’re here reading this, thank you so much for taking an interest in my little project! 🥰 I’m learning one step at a time, so if you have suggestions, tips, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out or leave feedback.

This might not be the most perfect or polished code, but it’s my first step into the world of C++, and I’m proud of it. 🌟

## 🌟 Future Plans
- Add networking to fetch random cow-related facts. 🐄
- Make the app run in the background like a true "thinking cow."
- Create a fun ASCII art cow to display messages.

Thanks for stopping by! Let’s moo-ve forward and keep building cool things! 🐮✨
